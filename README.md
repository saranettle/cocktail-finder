#Cocktail Finder

Hello, and welcome to my Github repo for my first Flask Application that uses a MySQL database. If you are learning Flask, please feel free to check out the files used to create this app.

The data that supplies that database comes from my cocktail web scraper. To learn more about it, visit my Github repo here:
